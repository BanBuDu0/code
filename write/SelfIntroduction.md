##Why you want to go to graduate school

I think at present, I just do many things in a superficial level, 
but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of knowledge and ability.
So I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value.

With the explosive development of IT industry in hangzhou, HangDian--One of the first five universities under construction in zhejiang province also in the wave of IT explosive devolopment. Besides, in life aspect, HangDian is near the subway station and the Fred square, it can meet all your needs. All in all, HANGDIAN is good school that I love.
